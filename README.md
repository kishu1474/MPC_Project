# MPC_Project

Hello,

For the user interaction, I created a small demo application.

So basically, I used 'Pycharm for python code', 'Sublime text for HTML code' and 'XAMPP and phpMyAdmin for MySql database'.

I also add some styling and for that, I used some online bootstrap templets.

Right now, I'm working on the connectivity between the python code and database.
